/**
 * Mana Well — arcane — a floor that inhales, then a column.
 *
 * Arcane — mana drains to a sigil and refluxes as a column.
 *
 * Elemental Codex data block: presentation (`meta`) and the live settings the
 * ability and its editor folder read. Plain data, no imports, so
 * `settings.js` can pull it in without a cycle. Dragging any field re-shapes
 * a cast that is already in the air.
