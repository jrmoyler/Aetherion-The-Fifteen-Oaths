# Characters from sheets

Hero costumes rebuilt in hand-written code from their concept turnaround sheets. No generation services, no
downloaded models: every garment, plate, strap and buckle is geometry emitted by a builder function, and every
surface (firecloth weave, fired ceramic, leather, oxidized iron) is a procedural shader. Code geometry cannot be
a pixel duplicate of a painting; the bar used here is that a side-by-side reads as the same character
(silhouette, colour blocking, every named element present and in the right place), and the differences that
remain are listed per hero below.

## What is in the game

`BodyFactory.createGltf` (game/src/three/models.js) now asks `character/sheets/wear.js` whether the hero has a
sheet recipe. If it does:

1. The groom pass still builds the procedural head, eyes and brows, but leaves hair and face gear to the recipe.
2. The baked costume is hidden. Every skinned mesh the GLB brought (the fused body surface and any appended
   `reconstructed-*` costume primitives) has its index filtered once; only what the recipe keeps stays. Both
   Kiln recipes keep `hands`: the hands and whatever is rigidly held in them (the baked weapon). So there are
   never two costumes on top of each other.
3. The recipe is compiled into ONE skinned mesh (one draw call) bound to the body's own skeleton with the
   body's bind matrix, so all 23 authored clips drive it. Geometry is cached per hero and quality tier and
   shared by every actor of that hero; tessellation scales with `ctx.quality.name` (low 0.6, medium 0.8, high 1).

Heroes without a recipe are untouched and keep their baked costume. `docs/qa/characters/in-game-kiln-ninja.jpg`
is the Kiln Ninja in the running game (offline, medium quality). The character preview dialog
(ui/character-preview.js) now goes through the same BodyFactory path, because the hidden baked surface is shared.

## The system (game/src/three/character/sheets/)

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `form.js` | The tailor's form: a parametric trunk, arm, leg and foot measured from the wearer's bind-pose joints, with per-recipe build (width, depth, belly, limb girth). Garments are offsets of this form, so they fit by construction and take their skin weights from it. |
| `kernel.js` | `Bag` (vertex/skin accumulator, grids with smooth normals, mirrored sides, hard-surface solids placed through any smooth map) and bevelled shapes (round box, slab, bar, ring, dome). |
| `builders.js` | The garment and gear builders: `skinLimb`, `neck`, `shirt`, `trousers` (gathered, pleated, piped), `wrap`, `band`, `capelet` (cloth laid over the shoulders and arms, asymmetric by run length), `cowl`, `chestPlates`, `belt`, `strap` (+ anchor ring), `bracer`, `blockBracer` (real vent slots), `gloveCuff`, `boots` (sole, upper, shaft, toe cap, heel and shin plates, straps), `halfMask` (vented grille), `hair` (spiky, bun), `skirt` (coat), `panel` (apron, tabard), `limbPlate`, `kilnPack`. |
| `hair.js` | The `hair` builder: a dark undercoat plus distinct tapered locks. Styles `spiky`, `long` (+ `tail` to tie it back), `bun` (a small high knot is a topknot), `braid`, `none` (+ `stubble`). |
| `hands.js` | The `hands` builder: palm, jointed fingers and thumb per hand, rigid on the hand bone; gloved, fingerless or bare; the weapon hand is a closed fist. |
| `material.js` | One procedural material; a per-vertex (roughness, metalness, kind) triple picks the detail in rest space: twill weave, soot and wear on cloth; pits, chips and kiln flashing on ceramic; grain, creases and scuffs on leather; pitting and rust on iron. Plates, bands and straps also carry darkened edges in their vertex colours. No textures, constructs in Node. |
| `costume.js` | Compiles a recipe into a geometry. |
| `recipes/` | One data file per hero: palette, build, what to keep of the baked mesh, and a list of builder calls. |
| `wear.js` | Runtime: measure the rig, hide the baked costume, bind the costume, hook dispose/fade. |
| `sheets.test.mjs` | Recipes reference shipped heroes and existing builders; every recipe builds in Node with no document on every tier and two body sizes; weights are normalised; builds are deterministic. |

Dev stage: `game/sheet.html?id=oath-01-ninja` renders front, back, side and three-quarter through the game's
BodyFactory (`clip=attack_1&frames=6`, `pose=bind`, `q=low|medium|high`). A new hero is a new file in
`recipes/` plus one line in `recipes/index.js`.

## Writing a recipe

```js
export default {
  id: 'oath-NN-ninja', sheet: 'reference-0NN', title: '...',
  palette: { cloth: '#...', leather: '#...', iron: '#...', hair: '#...' },   // `skin` defaults to the head's skin tone, `hollow` to near-black
  build: { width: 1, depth: 1, shoulder: 1, waist: 1, hips: 1, belly: 0, bust: 0, arm: 1, leg: 1, neck: 1 },   // multipliers on a lean athletic default
  keep: ['weapon'],                       // what stays of the baked mesh: 'weapon' (held weapon only) or 'hands' (baked hands and weapon)
  groom: { hair: false, gear: false },    // false = this recipe builds the hair / face gear itself
  builders: { myPart },                   // optional: extra builders from the group's own file
  parts: [{ use: 'shirt', sleeve: 2 }, { use: 'hands', glove: 'glove', fingerless: true }, { use: 'hair', style: 'long', tail: { length: .8, tie: 'leather' } }],
};
```

Hair: `{ use: 'hair', style: 'spiky'|'long'|'bun'|'braid'|'none', color, streak, length (head heights), density,
lift, fringe (front hairline height, -.5 chin .. .5 crown), knot: { at: [x, y, z] head space, radius, tie },
tail: { length, width, tie }, braid: { length, width, tie }, stubble }`. Head space: origin at the head's
centre, +y up, +z forward, chin to crown = 1.
Hands: `{ use: 'hands', glove: paletteName|null, fingerless, skin, fist: 'R'|'L'|'both'|'none', scale, knuckles }`.
A builder receives `(context, params)` with `context = { bag, form, rig, q, pal, rand, head }`; see the header of
builders.js. Register a recipe with one import line in `recipes/index.js`.

## Sheet to hero mapping

Read from the title printed on each sheet (and consistent with `tools/blender/characters/cf/heroes`).
reference-092..095 are sorcerer line-ups and 096..098 ninja line-ups across elements, not single heroes.

## Per-hero status

### oath-01-ninja (reference-090): done

Evidence: `docs/qa/characters/oath-01-ninja.jpg`. Present and placed as on the sheet: soot firecloth shirt with
short piped sleeves, a band of bare upper arm, dark bindings from above the elbow under leather vambraces with
buckled straps, asymmetric capelet over the right shoulder with terracotta trim, rolled hem and drape folds,
bunched cowl, diagonal strap with square anchor ring at the left shoulder, three stacked ceramic chest plates
front and back with iron clasps, side straps and riveted harness straps, leather belt with iron buckle and a
second thin belt, ceramic block bracer with three vent slots and iron hinge bands on the left forearm, glove
cuffs, trousers with side seams, pocket openings and terracotta piping, pleated into a leather band with
terracotta trim below the knee, ribbed shin wraps, boots with lugged sole, ceramic toe caps, shin and heel
plates and buckled straps, vented iron half mask with terracotta slats and head strap, layered spiky black hair.
Costume volumes are widened at the shoulders, chest, arms and legs toward the sheet's build.

Differs from the sheet:
- Hands are the baked GLB hands (dark glove texture); the fingerless glove fingers are not rebuilt.
- He holds his baked blade; the sheet shows him unarmed.
- Joints are the rig's: the neck is shorter and the legs less long than the painting, and the head reads larger.
- Trousers are fuller and rounder at the knee than the painted, slimmer cut; their folds are regular.
- Boot toes are rounder and redder than the painted dark boots with small plates.
- Hair is a cap of short layered spikes; the painted hair is longer on top with a looser parted fringe.
- The capelet's back follows the front's diagonal (the sheet's own back and side views disagree with its
  front about the capelet and strap side). No belt pouches or hanging strap ends; no stitching on leather.
- The face is the existing procedural head, not a likeness of the face panel.

### oath-01-sorcerer (reference-091): done, with more differences than the ninja

Evidence: `docs/qa/characters/oath-01-sorcerer.jpg`. Present: stocky build, long-sleeved firecloth coat to
mid-shin with terracotta hem trim, piped sleeve bands, terracotta apron bib and apron skirt with pale trim,
hip flaps, shoulder straps with iron buckles running over to the pack, wide studded belt with iron buckle,
ceramic forearm guards, heavy cuffs, baggy trousers gathered at the ankle, short heavy boots with ceramic toe
caps, kiln pack with iron binding, a vented door glowing ember orange and the square chimney, grey hair combed
back into a bun.

Differs from the sheet:
- Hands are the baked hands and she holds her baked focus; gauntlet fingers are not rebuilt.
- The pack is one firebox with a chimney; the painted pack has a second stepped stage and side latches, and
  its vent door is dark, not glowing.
- Shoulders are plain sleeves with two piped bands, not the painted layered shoulder pads.
- The apron is wider and brighter than the painted one, without its riveted strap ends.
- Hair is a combed cap, locks and a bun; no loose curls at the temples. The face is the procedural head and
  does not resemble the portrait.

### All other heroes: not started

They keep their baked costume. Each needs a recipe file; hoods, long robes with open fronts, beards and the
other face-gear families would need a few more builders (the existing groom gear still serves them meanwhile).

## Verification

Seen on screen (turnaround stage, through BodyFactory): both heroes idle from four sides, a chest close-up of
the ninja, the ninja in `attack_1` and running, the sorcerer in `cast_release` and running; and the ninja as
the player in the running game (before the quality pass). Not seen on screen: the low tier, the sorcerer in
the running game, NPCs wearing these bodies, the character preview dialog.
Sorcerer coat: in `cast_release` the raised knee no longer comes through (the skirt follows the thighs). In the
run the forward thigh's trouser pushed through the apron, so her trousers now start below the coat; re-rendered
with `from: .95` the thigh is clean and only a small notch showed at the apron's lower edge over the forward
knee. The start was then lowered to `from: 1.06`; that last value is built and unit-tested but not re-rendered.

## Cost

Kiln Ninja: about 35,000 triangles on high, 1 draw call; Kiln Sorcerer: about 29,000. The baked surface
(24k) is no longer drawn apart from the hands and weapon, so the net per-hero triangle count is close to before.
Build time is a few hundred milliseconds once per hero and tier, cached.
